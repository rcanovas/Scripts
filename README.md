Some simple scripts and small programs that could be useful.


## Programs:

-[CutFile] : Extracts the first n symbols of the file 'in_file' and copied to 'out_file'. If file has less than n symbols then out_file is a complete copy of file.
		Use: ./CutFile <in_file> <out_file> n
		Language: C++11
		Compile: g++ -std=c++11 cut_file.cpp -o CutFile
